Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Why Rust?

1. **Performance**: Comparable to C++.
2. **Safety**: Borrow checker ensures memory safety.
3. **Tooling**: Cargo is a fantastic package manager.

Rust is increasingly being used for web/cloud infrastructure (e.g., Cloudflare Pingora, various AWS components) and frontend tooling (e.g., SWC, Turbo).

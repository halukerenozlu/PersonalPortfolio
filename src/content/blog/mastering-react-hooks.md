React Hooks like `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are essential for modern React development.

## useEffect

Use it for side effects. Always be careful with your dependency array!

## useMemo

Memoize expensive calculations. Don't overuse it; premature optimization is the root of all evil.

## useCallback

Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

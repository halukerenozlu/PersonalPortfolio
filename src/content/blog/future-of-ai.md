Autonomous agents are rapidly changing how we approach software development. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), these agents can plan, execute, and verify complex tasks.

## Key Capabilities

- **Planning**: Breaking down high-level goals into actionable steps.
- **Tool Use**: Interacting with file systems, terminals, and browsers.
- **Memory**: Retaining context over long conversations.

The future of coding is collaborative!
